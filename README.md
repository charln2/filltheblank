# Fill The Blank
## Description
Fill The Blank is a simple web application that aims to emulate the fill-in-the-blank flashcard scheme as seen in Duolingo, Enki, SoloLearn, and Quizzlet. 
The end-goal of this project is to make it fully customizable--allowing users to insert their own drawings, parse their own questions, and collaborate with others in intuitive and engaging ways.
This project is still under its early stages of development.
